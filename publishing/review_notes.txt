App Review Notes - Clementine's Cafe

Summary of fixes in this build:
- Added required iOS permission strings to `Info.plist` (Camera, Microphone, Photo Library, Location when in use) and `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` for App Tracking Transparency.
- Added a Privacy Policy file in the `publishing/` folder. Please host it at an accessible URL and paste the URL in App Store Connect.
- Prepared reviewer credentials and reproduction steps below.

Reviewer credentials (replace with working demo account):
- Username: reviewer@example.com
- Password: password123

How to reproduce the main flows:
1. Install and launch the app.
2. On first launch, if applicable, you will be prompted for permissions (camera/microphone/photos/location) — grant or decline to test both paths.
3. If tracking is present, you should see the App Tracking Transparency prompt. You can allow or deny to test behavior.
4. Navigate to the main web/content flow and verify content loads.
