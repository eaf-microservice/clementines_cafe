## Notes

- Ensure screenshots are high-resolution (retina quality) — they appear to be appropriately sized.
- Screenshots should show the main app flows: login, main content, key features.
- Keep text readable and avoid showing sensitive data.
- If you need to add captions, do so in App Store Connect's preview text field.
